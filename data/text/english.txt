msg1			Hello! As you may have already noticed, you can use the arrow keys (or 'A' and 'D') to move around and the space bar (or 'J') to jump. Use 'Esc' to pause the game and the up arrow (or 'W') to open doors and talk to bombies like me. (down arrow or 'S' to advance...)/This is Tars Island, a formerly peaceful place, until the day that Chamal invaded with his mechanic animals...
msg2			You can use items like this one before me by pressing 'A' (or 'K') after you collected it. Items you have collected will appear on the top right corner of the screen./If you have collected more than one type of item, you can use 'Shift' (or 'L') to switch between them.
msg3			This creature ahead is quite dangerous... you can try using one of these missiles you have been collecting, or just sneak under it, if possible.
msg4			Always pay attention to the scenery around you, for it can hide many secrets like this.
msg5			This glittering artifact is a Spec. Legend says there are many of them scattered around the world, and one who is able to gather them all will have the key to a path to the magical forest of Lae.../But it's just a legend, right? Hahaha...
msg6			Look, it's gunpowder! Now you can unleash your bomb power! Look for cracks in walls to open paths or just kill your enemies without needing to touch them./But mind the time! You only have 10 seconds after you made contact with the gunpowder.
msg7			You see this wooden board over there? You can attach it to the floor to extend it, when needing to leap over a large chasm. Once attached, you will need a hammer to release it and be able to use it again.
msg8			This is Chamal's fortress, and only danger awaits you... Be very careful from now on.
msg9			Try rolling that ball over this little star mark in the floor, and see what happens!
msg10			Well... That's it for the demo. But keep your eyes on alevagames.com for news on the next release!
msg_monep		Hey! Hold on! If you want to go any further, you must bring me a Forest Herb. Yes, a delicious Forest Herb... Now get lost and only come back here when you have it!

movie_0_1		In a distant land, there is a beautiful village inhabited by living... bombs.
movie_0_2		This village was once a peaceful place, where the people loved their king and had prosperous lives.
movie_0_3		But the envy of Gaxlon, one of the king's counselors, has just unsettled this tranquility...
movie_0_4		Gaxlon wanted to rule the kingdom by himself, but as he wasn't really prepared for such task, he imprisoned Aldan, the king, so that he could forcibly extract "advice" on how to govern.
movie_0_5		Gaxlon:\n"Now, Aldan, you be a nice ex-king and tell me how to do your work, so that the people love me instead of you, hahahahah!"
movie_0_6		Aldan:\n"Hah! As if what you really wanted was to be loved by the people! It's so sad... I trusted you so much, Gaxlon, and now what have you become for the sake of power!?"
game_end		The End!
game_end_sub	But... have you collected all the Specs?
game_end_2		The End!
game_end_2_sub	Seriously, now.
